# Algorithms and Data structures - ALG2
This repository serves to storing all projects that are related to the course. All data structures and sort or search algorithms.

## Contents
All data structures will be stored here. It will be documented as well. So you can study from it if you want and if you will understand it. :D

### Data structures information
In short it's sort of data organization or management of data we store. It's typically some collection of data values.

#### Types of data structures
I will list some types of data structures that we will use.

- Linked list
- Array list
- Binary tree

### Linked list
It's common list, collection of values that is organized using so-called **pointers**.

Linked list is arranged using **Linked list nodes**, objects that hold value and pointer to its previous or next **linked list node**.

There are a few types of linked list nodes. e.g.:
- Singly linked list
- Doubly linked list
- Circular linked list

#### Singly linked list
This linked list works only in one way. It can only see linked list nodes in the next pointer. Linked list node doesn't hold a pointer to previous node.

#### Doubly linked list
This linked list works only in both ways. It can see linked list nodes in both ways. Linked list node holds pointer to previous or next node.

#### Circular linked list
This linked list works the same way as **Doubly linked list**. There is some special feature - the last node hold pointer to previous node and the first node in the list (because next node of the last node is the first node in the list), and first node hold pointer to next node and last node (because previous node to first node is the last node in the list).

### Array list
Array list is same type of collection like **Linked list**. For organization of data it uses Array instead of pointers (**Linked list nodes**).
I think there is no need for more information.
